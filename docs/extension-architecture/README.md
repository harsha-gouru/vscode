# Extension Architecture Docs

This folder contains auto-generated documentation for VS Code's built-in extensions.
Each Markdown file summarizes key architectural details extracted from the extension's
`package.json` (and `package.nls.json` when present).

To regenerate these files, run:

```bash
node scripts/generateExtensionDocs.js
```
